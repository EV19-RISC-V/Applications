  Altera DE0-Nano Development Board
</p>

Several applications were developed in order to prove the potential of the implementation. The softcore was synthesized in a Altera DE0-Nano Development Board, and a custom PCB was designed to be able to connect a VGA monitor and a PS2 keyboard. With this setup, progams can receive input from a keyboard and send text and video output to a screen.

  Mandelbrot Set
</p>

An interesting and computing expensive application is fractal computing. In this case, the Mandelbrot Set was used as an example. The program computes the fractal in real time and interacts with the user through keyboard arrows and hotkeys, swiping throug the fractal, zooming in/out specific areas, and also setting the level of detail used to render the image.
